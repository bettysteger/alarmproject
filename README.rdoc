* this project has a heavy database
* we are exploring how to work with lots of data with Rails 3 and MongoDB
* our data is located in db/data (1,7 GB) .. this folder is in the gitignore, see below where you can download the data
* example data for testing is located in test/fixtures

== usage
get data into json files:
  rake db:get_data
then start mongo server:
  rake db:mongo:start
import json objects in mongodb
  rake db:import
  
example queries: (further information in config/routes.rb)
